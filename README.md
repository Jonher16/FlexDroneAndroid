# DJI Android UX SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UXSDK-Beta-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UXSDK-Beta-Android)

The DJI UX SDK speeds up development time by providing UI elements for all core functionalities, and by using it in conjunction with the [DJI Mobile SDK](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/) you can create a customized mobile app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform. Using the default UX SDK, an application can be created with no additional lines of code; you can also pick and choose which elements you want to use for maximum UI flexibility.

With the UX SDK 5.0 version we are introducing an easy way to customize all the UI elements, as well as extend the base classes to build your own custom widgets. For more details, see the [UX SDK 5.0 overview](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UXSDK-Beta-Android/wiki/UX-SDK-5.0-Overview).

Check out our sample app code in this repository with instructions on how to get started [here](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UXSDK-Beta-Android/wiki/Sample-Application-Tutorial).
